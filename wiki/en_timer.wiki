|| TIMER_MSEC_PER_DAY || Number of milliseconds per day. ||

== Typedefs ==
|| timer_snap_t || typedef struct _timer_snap_t  timer_snap_t || Data structure for holding a time value. ||

=== timer_passed ===
Check that `msec' milliseconds passed since the `t0' moment.

=== timer_delay ===
Delay the current task by the given time in milliseconds.

=== timer_milliseconds ===
Return the (real) time in milliseconds since uOS start.
