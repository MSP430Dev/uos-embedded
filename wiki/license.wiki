as published by the Free Software Foundation; either version 2, or (at your option) any

General Public License for more details.

As a special exception, including uOS header files in a file,
instantiating uOS generics or templates, or linking other files
with uOS objects to produce an executable application, does not
by itself cause the resulting executable application to be covered
by the GNU General Public License. This exception does not
however invalidate any other reasons why the executable file might be
covered by the GNU Public License.

The license does not require users to release the source code of any
applications that are developed with uOS. However, if anybody makes
any changes to code covered by the uOS license, or writes new files
derived in any way from uOS code, then we believe that the entire user
community should have the opportunity to benefit from this. The license
stipulates that these changes must be made available in source code form
to all recipients of binaries based on the modified code.

Although it is not strictly necessary to contribute the modified code
back to the uOS open source project, we are always pleased to receive
code contributions and hope that developers will also be keen to give
back in return for what they received from the uOS project completely
free of charge. The uOS maintainers are responsible for deciding whether
such contributions should be applied to the public repository.
